- 👋 Hi, I’m @chabs300
A PhD student in civil/structural engineering with a former bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical engineering.
However, my key strength in these engineering topics are in numerical simulation (MBS, DEM, ...) and the development of own specific models/solvers (vehicle-track interaction) for the railway industry which highly involves advanced programming.
In the future I want to head more towards actual software development in an area where my previously mentioned knowledge from my degree is required.
Currently working a lot with Python and Matlab, and a little bit of C++.

- I’m looking to collaborate on scientific software and models for engineering purposes.
